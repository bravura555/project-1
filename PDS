            <p>There is a thirty (30) day Waiting Period applicable to the Accidental Injury or Sickness Benefit commencing on the date You are unable to engage in Your Permanent Employment. If You have returned to Your Permanent Employment within three (3) months of the date of Your original Accidental Injury or manifestation of Your Sickness and, as a result of Your original Accidental Injury or Sickness, You are again prevented from engaging in Your Permanent Employment, this will be deemed one (1) Event and the thirty (30) day Waiting Period will not apply.</p>
            <h4>Premiums</h4>
            <p>We take a number of factors into account when calculating Your premium which could include the risk profile and the level of cover You have selected. Your premium is paid in advance and includes any amounts payable that take into account Our obligation (actual or estimated) to pay any relevant compulsory government charges, taxes, levies (including stamp duty and GST) in relation to the Policy. We will tell You, when You apply, what premium is payable, when it needs to be paid and how it can be paid. If You will be paying Your premium by instalment payments and an instalment remains unpaid for at least fourteen (14) days, We may refuse to pay a claim arising after the instalment was due. If an instalment remains unpaid for thirty-one (31) days, Your Policy will be automatically cancelled without written notice from Us to You unless We elect to cancel earlier by providing You with written notice. We may change Your premium from the Renewal Date if We notify You of the change in writing prior to that date.</p>

            <h4>Personal Information Handling Practices</h4>
            <h5>Collection, Use and Disclosure</h5>
            <p>We collect your personal information (which may include sensitive information) when you are applying for, changing or renewing an insurance policy with us or when we are processing a claim in order to help us properly administrate your insurance proposal, policy or claim. Personal information may be obtained by us directly from you or via a third party such as your insurance intermediary or employer (e.g. in the case of a group insurance policy). When information is provided to us via a third party we use that information on the basis that you have consented or would reasonably expect us to collect your personal information in this way and we take reasonable steps to ensure that you have been made aware of how we handle your personal information. The primary purpose for our collection and use of your personal information is to enable us to provide insurance services to you. Sometimes, we may use your personal information for our marketing campaigns, in relation to new products, services or information that may be of interest to you. We may disclose the information we collect to third parties, including service providers engaged by us to carry out certain business activities on our behalf (such as assessors and call centres in Australia). In some circumstances, in order to provide our services to you, we may need to transfer personal information to other entities within the ACE Group of companies, (such as the regional head offices of ACE located in Singapore, UK or USA) or third parties with whom we, or those other ACE Group entities, have sub-contracted to provide a specific service for us and these may be outside of Australia. In particular, certain business process functions of ACE are performed by a dedicated servicing unit located in the Philippines. Please note that no personal information is disclosed by us to any overseas entity for marketing purposes. In all instances where personal information may be disclosed overseas, in addition to any local data privacy laws, we have measures in place to ensure that those parties hold and use that information in accordance with the consent you have provided and in accordance with our obligations to you under the Privacy Act 1998 (Cth).</p>
            <h5>Your Choices</h5>
            <p>In dealing with us, you agree to us using and disclosing your personal information as set out in this statement and our Privacy Policy. This consent remains valid unless you alter or revoke it by giving written notice to our Privacy Officer. However, should you choose to withdraw your consent it is important for you to understand that this may mean we may not be able to provide you or your organisation with insurance or to respond to any claim.</p>

            <p>ACE has authorised Lodestar to distribute this FSG and to provide the services listed under the heading “How Lodestar provides its services,” on ACE’s behalf. In providing the relevant services, Lodestar does not act on your behalf. ACE is the issuer of the relevant DeviceCover.com.au products that Lodestar promotes, unless ACE or Lodestar tells you otherwise. Lodestar may act for other licensees. If Lodestar offers you financial se¬rvices on behalf of another licensee, it will provide you with a copy of the relevant FSG in relation to those services.</p>
            <a class='backtop' href='#content' id='services'>back to top</a>
            <h3>How ACE provides its services</h3>
            <p>ACE may provide a dealing service, with or without general advice, in relation to the general insurance products that ACE distributes. When ACE issues general insurance products, ACE acts on its own behalf, not yours. In dealing with DeviceCover, ACE will collect information from Lodestar or you to be able to market and issue the product and manage your and ACE’s rights and obligations under the product. ACE will also give you factual information about the product to help you decide whether to buy the DeviceCover.</p>
            <p>In some cases ACE may also make a general recommendation or give an opinion about DeviceCover which is not based on ACE’s consideration of your individual objectives, financial situation or needs.</p>
            <p>In providing a general advice service, ACE cannot tell you whether the insurance, or an option within it, is appropriate for you specifically. As a result, you need to consider the appropriateness of any information or general advice ACE gives you, having regard to your objectives, financial situation and needs, before acting on it.  You need to read the relevant policy documentation (including the PDS) to determine if it is suitable for you.</p>
            <h3>HOW ACE IS PAID FOR ITS SERVICES</h3>
            <h4>Payment for the services ACE provides</h4>
            <p>As the issuer of any insurance policy, we will charge you an agreed premium for that product based on a number of factors including your risk profile and circumstances (plus relevant taxes and charges) which we will calculate and provide you with before you buy the product.</p>
            <h4>Remuneration of our staff</h4>
            <p>All permanent ACE employees are paid an annual salary.  An annual bonus may be paid in some circumstances, which can be based on performance against sales targets and other performance criteria.</p>
            <p>All temporary ACE employees receive hourly wages or such wages otherwise agreed for a fixed term or contract.  Performance-based payments may also be paid in some circumstances.</p>
            <p>ACE employees may also receive other non-monetary benefits such as attendance at business related conferences, study trips, other functions or gift vouchers.</p>
            <h4>Referral to ACE by third parties</h4>
            <p>In certain cases, we may have a relationship with a third party who we may pay for referring you to us.  We may pay them a referral fee which is a percentage of the net premium of an insurance policy (which is the total premium payable less GST and Stamp Duty).</p>
            <p>This referral fee is already incorporated into the premium payable by you and the amount can vary, depending on the type of arrangement we have with the third party and the type of insurance product you purchase.  The amount we pay them includes a reimbursement of expenses they incur in performing their role, for example marketing, postage, telephone, printing and call centre costs.  The referral fee is normally payable to third parties on a monthly or quarterly basis, in arrears.</p>
            <h4>Further information</h4>
            <p>You can ask us to give you more particulars of the remuneration or other benefits referred to above within a reasonable period after receiving this FSG and before we provide you with the financial service to which this FSG relates, unless we agree otherwise.</p>

            <h3>Telemarketing companies renumeration</h3>
            <p>ACE, with Lodestar’s prior consent, may authorise a number of telemarketing companies to provide services on its behalf for which they receive remuneration from ACE. See below for further details about their remuneration. These services may include an inbound and outbound call centre to assist you in applying for DeviceCover and to answer any general queries you may have aboutDeviceCover.com. The telemarketing companies follow procedures set by ACE and may also provide you with general advice which has been prepared and authorised by ACE and Lodestar. In providing these services, the telemarketing companies act on ACE’s behalf, not yours. The telemarketing companies may also act on behalf of other licensees. For further details, please contact ACE on 1800 023 804.</p>
            <h4>Remuneration of a telemarketing company’s staff</h4>
            Depending on the particulars of each telemarketing campaign, a telemarketing company’s employees will receive a salary or a fee which is an hourly rate negotiated with the telemarketing company and may also receive one or more of the following benefits which are based on the employees’ performance against sales targets and other performance criteria:
            <ul>
              <li>soft dollar benefits which can include gift vouchers, meals, entertainment such as tickets to sporting events and gifts such as bottles of wine; and/or ;</li>
              <li>weekly monetary bonuses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These benefits are paid by the telemarketing company and not ACE. The identity and remuneration of individual operators should not impact the service provided or be material to your decision to enter into an insurance contract with ACE.</p>
            <h4>Referral to ACE by third parties</h4>
            <p>In certain cases, we may have a relationship with a third party who we may pay for referring you to us. We may pay them a referral fee which is a percentage of the net premium of an insurance policy (which is the total premium payable less GST, Stamp Duty and Fire Services Levy, where applicable). This referral fee is already incorporated into the premium payable by you and the amount can vary, depending on the type of arrangement we have with the third party and the type of insurance product you purchase. The amount we pay them includes a reimbursement of expenses they incur in performing their role, for example marketing, postage, telephone, printing and call centre costs. The referral fee is normally payable to third parties on a monthly or quarterly basis, in arrears.</p>

          </div>
          <div class='modal-body'>
            <p>The privacy of your personal information is very important to Lodestar Insurance Pty Ltd ( 'us', 'our' or 'we').</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy details how Lodestar collects, uses and protects an individual’s personal information in accordance with our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Privacy Act”).</p>
            <p>The terms of our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The current terms will be displayed on the website.</p>
            <h3>About the Privacy Act</h3>
            <p>The Federal Government's Privacy Act regulates, via the Australian Privacy Principles, the way private sector organizations can collect, use, keep, secure and disclose personal information.</p>
            <p>Personal information includes information that can be used to identify an individual e.g name, address, telephone number, age, and details about your devices.</p>
            <p>The aim of the law is to ensure that private organisations that hold personal information about people, handle that information responsibly. It also gives people some control over the way information about them is handled. For example, it gives individuals the right to know what personal information an organization holds about them and a right to correct that information if it is wrong.</p>
            <h3>Information Collected</h3>
            <p>We collect personal information from you that is relevant to providing products and services to you. Where possible, we collect it directly from you.</p>
            <p>We will only do so with your consent, or otherwise in accordance with the Privacy Act. That consent may be express, or implied, such as when you have been informed verbally, or when you continue a telephone call with our staff, after you have heard a recorded message.</p>
            <h3>Online Privacy</h3>
            <p>We may collect some personally identifiable information about you at different times depending on how you choose to access our website.</p>
            <p>If you submit your e-mail address for a request it will be used to complete that request and send a reply. If you submit your email address for the purpose of purchasing membership on-line, we may also use it to provide you with specific information regarding your merbership products.</p>
            <p>We may request your e-mail address for the inclusion into a mailing list. If you choose to submit your e-mail address an option to remove this address from our database will be offered to you via e-mail correspondence. All opt-in e-mails sent to the mailing list will comply with the Australian Spam Act.</p>
