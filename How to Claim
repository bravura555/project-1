          <div class='modal-body'>
            <p>The privacy of your personal information is very important to Lodestar Insurance Pty Ltd ( 'us', 'our' or 'we').</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy details how Lodestar collects, uses and protects an individual’s personal information in accordance with our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Privacy Act”).</p>
            <p>The terms of our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The current terms will be displayed on the website.</p>
            <h3>About the Privacy Act</h3>
            <p>The Federal Government's Privacy Act regulates, via the Australian Privacy Principles, the way private sector organizations can collect, use, keep, secure and disclose personal information.</p>
            <p>Personal information includes information that can be used to identify an individual e.g name, address, telephone number, age, and details about your devices.</p>
            <p>The aim of the law is to ensure that private organisations that hold personal information about people, handle that information responsibly. It also gives people some control over the way information about them is handled. For example, it gives individuals the right to know what personal information an organization holds about them and a right to correct that information if it is wrong.</p>
            <h3>Information Collected</h3>
            <p>We collect personal information from you that is relevant to providing products and services to you. Where possible, we collect it directly from you.</p>
            <p>We will only do so with your consent, or otherwise in accordance with the Privacy Act. That consent may be express, or implied, such as when you have been informed verbally, or when you continue a telephone call with our staff, after you have heard a recorded message.</p>
            <h3>Online Privacy</h3>
            <p>We may collect some personally identifiable information about you at different times depending on how you choose to access our website.</p>
            <p>If you submit your e-mail address for a request it will be used to complete that request and send a reply. If you submit your email address for the purpose of purchasing membership on-line, we may also use it to provide you with specific information regarding your merbership products.</p>
            <p>We may request your e-mail address for the inclusion into a mailing list. If you choose to submit your e-mail address an option to remove this address from our database will be offered to you via e-mail correspondence. All opt-in e-mails sent to the mailing list will comply with the Australian Spam Act.</p>
            <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
            <p>From time to time, we may use data collection devices such as 'cookies' in conjunction with our website. Cookies are commonly used on the internet. They are a small file placed onto a computer by a server. A cookie can later be identified by a server. We may use both 'persistent' and 'session cookies'.
